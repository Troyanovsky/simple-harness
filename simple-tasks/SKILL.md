# Simple Tasks — Break Down a Feature into an Ordered Task List

You are creating an ordered task list for a feature. Your job is to produce an `issues.json` file
inside `docs/<feature-name>/` that gives an AI coding agent (or a human developer) a clear,
prioritized work queue — each task small enough to implement in a single session, ordered so that
dependencies are respected and the feature comes together incrementally.

This skill consumes the output of **simple-spec** and **simple-design** (and optionally
**simple-visual**). It pairs with **simple-implement**, which picks tasks from this list one at
a time, and **simple-run**, which orchestrates the loop.

## Folder convention

All feature artifacts live in `docs/<feature-name>/`:

```
docs/
  index.json              ← feature manifest (created/updated by this skill)
  visual.md               ← from simple-visual (app-level, optional)
  <feature-name>/
    spec.md               ← from simple-spec
    spec/                 ← optional detail files (from simple-spec, if spec.md was split)
    design.md             ← from simple-design
    design/               ← optional detail files (from simple-design, if design.md was split)
    issues.json           ← THIS SKILL'S OUTPUT
    progress-log.md       ← created by simple-implement
```

The `<feature-name>` token is a short kebab-case identifier (e.g., `auth`, `workspace-sharing`,
`csv-export`) that ties all artifacts together by directory.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather context

Start by collecting all available planning documents **before** asking the user anything.

**Required inputs:**
- Read `docs/<feature-name>/spec.md` — this is your primary source for *what* to build, user
  stories, acceptance criteria, and edge cases.
- Read `docs/<feature-name>/design.md` — this tells you *how* to build it: architecture, data
  flow, interfaces, affected components, testing strategy.
- If `spec.md` or `design.md` indexes child detail files (a `spec/` or `design/` subfolder), read
  those too. They hold the page-level detail you need to size tasks accurately and to point each
  task at the right section.

**Optional inputs:**
- Read `docs/visual.md` if it exists — this is the app-level visual design system. UI/visual tasks need this context.
- Scan the codebase to understand its current state, conventions, and complexity. This helps
  you size tasks accurately and identify prerequisites.

**If inputs are missing:**
- If the user hasn't specified a feature name, check `docs/` for existing feature subdirectories
  and ask which one to break down. If there's only one, use it.
- If `spec.md` or `design.md` doesn't exist, tell the user and suggest running **simple-spec**
  or **simple-design** first. You can still proceed if the user provides enough context directly,
  but the output quality will be lower — say so explicitly.

### 2. Ask follow-up questions (only if needed)

After reading the planning docs, assess whether you have enough to produce a good breakdown.
Common gaps:

- **Granularity preference:** "The design describes 3 major components. Should each be one task,
  or should I break them into smaller units (e.g., data model, API, UI separately)?"
- **Priority signals:** "The spec has 5 user stories — are any higher priority than others, or
  should I order by technical dependency only?"
- **Scope confirmation:** "The spec marks X as out-of-scope, but the design references it.
  Should I include it or flag it as a discrepancy?"
- **Testing expectations:** "Should testing be a separate task per component, or bundled into
  each implementation task?"

Keep it to one round of 1-4 focused questions. If you can make reasonable choices from the
planning docs, do so — you can note assumptions in the task descriptions.

### 3. Generate the task list

Read the template at `references/issues_template.json` in this skill's directory. Use it as the
structural guide for your output.

**Required fields for every task:**

| Field                | Type            | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                 | string          | `TASK-<feature>-001` format, zero-padded, sequential     |
| `type`               | string          | `"story"` \| `"bug"` \| `"task"` \| `"chore"`           |
| `title`              | string          | Short imperative summary (e.g., "Add sharing permissions model") |
| `description`        | string          | Concise but sufficient detail for an agent to implement  |
| `acceptance_criteria` | array of string | Success conditions — specific and verifiable             |
| `status`             | string          | Always `"todo"` when generated by this skill             |
| `priority`           | integer         | 1 = highest. Determines execution order                  |
| `depends_on`         | array of string | IDs of tasks that must complete first. Empty if none     |

**Optional fields** — add these when the project complexity warrants it:

- `estimated_effort`: `"small"` | `"medium"` | `"large"` — relative sizing
- `tags`: array of strings for categorization (e.g., `["backend", "database"]`)
- `notes`: string for context that doesn't fit elsewhere
- `blocked_reason`: string explaining why a task is blocked (used by simple-implement)
- `files_likely_affected`: array of file paths the task will probably touch

The agent is free to add other fields as needed for complex projects. The required fields are
the contract that **simple-implement** depends on.

**Key principles:**

- **Order by dependency, then by priority.** Tasks with no dependencies and high priority come
  first. Tasks that depend on others come after their dependencies. The `priority` field is the
  tiebreaker when dependencies are equal.

- **Each task should be completable in one session.** If a task feels like it would take more
  than a few hours of focused work, break it into smaller pieces. An agent should be able to
  pick up a single task, implement it, verify it, and move on.

- **Tasks should be independently verifiable.** Each task's acceptance criteria should be
  testable without completing subsequent tasks. This means the feature builds up incrementally —
  each task leaves the codebase in a working state.

- **Reference the planning docs, don't duplicate them.** Task descriptions should point back to
  specific sections of the spec or design (e.g., "Implement the sharing permissions model
  described in design.md § Proposed storage changes", or a child file such as
  "design/permissions.md § Schema changes"). Don't copy entire sections.

- **Include setup and testing tasks.** Don't skip the boring stuff: database migrations, config
  changes, test scaffolding, CI updates. These are tasks too and they often block other work.

- **Be specific about what "done" means.** "Implement the API endpoint" is vague. "Implement
  POST /api/workspaces/:id/share — validates input, creates sharing record, returns 201 with
  sharing details. Returns 409 if already shared with that user." is verifiable.

- **Map user stories to tasks, but don't force a 1:1 mapping.** A single user story might
  require multiple tasks (data model + API + UI). Multiple simple stories might be one task.
  The design document's "affected components" and "planned changes" sections are usually the
  best guide for task boundaries.

### 4. Save the output

- Save the task list to `docs/<feature-name>/issues.json`.
- Update (or create) `docs/index.json` at the project root. This is a lightweight manifest:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "<feature-name>": {
      "status": "tasks_ready",
      "path": "docs/<feature-name>/"
    }
  }
}
```

Valid feature statuses: `"planning"`, `"spec_ready"`, `"design_ready"`, `"tasks_ready"`,
`"in_progress"`, `"done"`.

- Tell the user the file path and give a brief summary: how many tasks, what the critical path
  looks like, and any assumptions you made.

### 5. Suggest next step

Let the user know the task list is ready for implementation. Mention that they can:

- Use **simple-implement** to work through tasks one at a time (manual control).
- Use **simple-run** to automatically loop through all tasks until the feature is complete.
- Review and adjust the task list before starting — reorder, split, merge, or remove tasks
  as needed. The JSON format makes this easy.

## Important notes

- This skill produces a **task breakdown**, not a spec or design — focus on *what work units to
  do and in what order*, not requirements or architecture. If you find yourself writing user
  stories or proposing technical approaches, reference the planning docs instead.
- Keep the task count proportional to complexity — a small feature might have 3-5 tasks, a large
  one 15-25. Don't inflate or compress artificially.
- If the spec and design disagree, flag it as a discrepancy for the user to resolve rather than
  silently picking one.
- All tasks start with `status: "todo"` — only **simple-implement** changes task status.
- `depends_on` forms a DAG — no circular dependencies. If two tasks are truly co-dependent,
  merge them into one.
